## Overview
Medieval Europe, also known as the Middle Ages, represents the middle period of European history, spanning roughly from the 5th to the 15th centuries. This era began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and ended with the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The period is traditionally subdivided into Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.

Medieval Europe was characterized by the synthesis of Germanic, Roman, and Christian traditions. The Catholic Church played a central role in medieval society, providing unity across diverse peoples and political entities. The feudal system dominated political and social organization, while manorialism structured rural economic life.

The period saw significant developments in architecture (Gothic cathedrals), education (universities), law (canon law, common law), and technology (agricultural and mechanical innovations). Despite periods of warfare and social upheaval, the Middle Ages laid the groundwork for many aspects of European civilization that would continue into the modern era.

## Cultural Code
Medieval Europe's "code" was structured around Christian faith as the unifying force, feudal obligations that created a complex web of loyalties, and a hierarchical view of society where each person had their designated place. The culture valued religious devotion, chivalric ideals, and the pursuit of knowledge within a Christian framework through scholasticism.
