**Geography:** Present-day southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador  
**Core Values:** Cosmic order and cyclical time, divine kingship, ritual bloodletting, astronomical observation, hierarchical social order  
**Political System:** City-states ruled by divine kings (k'uhul ajaw), complex political alliances and conflicts  
**Major Innovations:** Advanced mathematics (including concept of zero), calendar systems, hieroglyphic writing, astronomy, architecture  
**Dependencies:** Influenced by earlier Mesoamerican cultures (Olmec), developed independently with some regional interactions  
**Forks:** Post-Classic Maya states, surviving Maya communities to the present  

## Overview
The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, noted for its hieroglyphic script—the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas—as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.

The civilization is typically divided into three periods: the Preclassic (2000 BCE-250 CE), Classic (250-900 CE), and Postclassic (900-1697 CE) periods. The Classic period was the peak of Maya civilization, with major city-states like Tikal, Calakmul, and Caracol reaching their greatest extent and population.

The Maya are credited with the only known fully developed written language of the pre-Columbian Americas. They were also skilled astronomers, mathematicians, and architects who developed complex ceremonial centers with pyramids, temples, and palaces.

## Cultural Code
Maya civilization's "code" was deeply rooted in cosmic order and cyclical time. Their society was structured around divine kingship, where rulers were considered intermediaries between the human and divine realms. The Maya placed great importance on astronomical observation, mathematics, and ritual practices. Their hieroglyphic writing system encoded complex historical and ceremonial information.
