## Overview
Ancient Rome began as a small agricultural community on the Italian Peninsula that developed into one of the largest empires in the ancient world. At its height, the Roman Empire encompassed the entire Mediterranean basin and much of Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. Rome's system of government evolved from a monarchy to a republic and finally to an empire. The Romans were known for their practical approach to governance, engineering, and law, many aspects of which continue to influence the world today.

The Roman Republic was characterized by a complex system of checks and balances, while the Empire established a more centralized form of government that maintained control over vast territories for centuries. Roman culture was pragmatic, borrowing and adapting elements from other cultures, particularly Greek.

## Cultural Code
Ancient Rome's "code" emphasized practical solutions, legal frameworks, and efficient administration. The Romans valued duty to the state, military discipline, and civic responsibility. Their legal and administrative systems were designed to govern a multicultural empire efficiently, and they emphasized engineering and infrastructure to connect their vast territories.
