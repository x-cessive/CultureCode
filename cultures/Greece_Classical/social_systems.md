# Social Systems of Classical Greece

## Government
Classical Greece was organized around independent city-states (poleis), each with its own system of government:

### Athens (Democracy)
Athens developed the world's first known democracy (demos = people, kratos = power). Key features included:
- Direct participation of male citizens in the Ecclesia (assembly)
- Selection of officials by lot (sortition) rather than election
- Payment for public service to ensure participation by all classes
- Ostracism to prevent any individual from gaining excessive power

### Sparta (Mixed Constitution)
Sparta had a unique dual monarchy with two kings, two Ephors (elected magistrates), and a council of elders (Gerousia). The system emphasized military discipline and equality among Spartiates.

### Other Systems
- Oligarchies in various city-states
- Tyrannies (though often popular)
- Confederations like the Delian League

## Economics
The Greek economy was based on:
- Agriculture (wheat, barley, olives, grapes)
- Maritime trade across the Mediterranean
- Silver mining (especially at Laurion in Athens)
- Craft production (pottery, metalwork, textiles)
- Slavery (slaves made up 20-30% of the population in some areas)

## Family Structure
- Patriarchal system with male head of household (oikos)
- Women had limited rights and were largely confined to domestic sphere
- Marriage was arranged, with bride typically around 14-16
- Children were educated differently based on gender and social class
- Strong emphasis on lineage and ancestry

- **Men**: Full citizens, participated in political life, engaged in trade or warfare
- **Women**: Largely excluded from public life, managed households, raised children
- **Hetairai**: Educated courtesans who had more freedom and education than typical women
