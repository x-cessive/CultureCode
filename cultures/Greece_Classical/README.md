## Overview
Classical Greece refers to the period when Greek culture reached its zenith, particularly during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. This era is known for its significant contributions to philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, literature, and the arts. The period also saw the development of democracy in Athens and the rise of the polis (city-state) as the fundamental political unit.

The Classical Period emerged after the Greek victory over the Persian Empire and was marked by significant cultural and intellectual achievements. It ended with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, which ushered in the Hellenistic Age.

## Cultural Code
Classical Greece's "code" was characterized by its emphasis on reason, the pursuit of knowledge, and civic participation. The Greeks valued arete (excellence) in all forms, from athletic competitions to intellectual pursuits. Their society was organized around independent city-states (poleis), with Athens pioneering the concept of democracy.
