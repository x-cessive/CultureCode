## Overview
The Han Dynasty represents one of the most significant periods in Chinese history, establishing many features that would define Chinese civilization for the next two millennia. The dynasty is divided into two periods: the Western Han (206 BCE – 9 CE) and the Eastern Han (25–220 CE), separated by the brief Xin Dynasty of Wang Mang. 

The Han period saw major developments in science, technology, arts, and literature. It was during this time that China's identity as a unified state under imperial rule was solidified. The term "Han Chinese" originates from this dynasty and is still used today to describe the majority ethnic group in China.

The Han Dynasty established the foundation for the Chinese imperial system, including the civil service examination system, which selected government officials based on merit rather than birth. The dynasty also saw the establishment of Confucianism as the state ideology and the expansion of the Silk Road trade networks.

## Cultural Code
Han Dynasty China's "code" emphasized harmony, both social and cosmic. The culture was built around Confucian ideals of proper relationships and hierarchy, integrated with Daoist concepts of harmony with nature. The government was structured as a centralized bureaucracy with a merit-based civil service system. The Mandate of Heaven provided the philosophical foundation for imperial rule.
