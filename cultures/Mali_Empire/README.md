## Overview
The Mali Empire was a powerful West African empire that emerged in the 13th century CE and became one of the largest empires in history. Founded by Sundiata Keita, the "Lion King," the empire grew from the former lands of the Ghana Empire and expanded to control vast areas of West Africa. 

The Mali Empire was known for its wealth, particularly from gold mining and trade. The empire's most famous ruler, Mansa Musa I, is often considered one of the wealthiest people in history. His pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 demonstrated the empire's wealth and made Mali famous throughout the Islamic world and beyond.

The empire was characterized by a sophisticated political system, extensive trade networks, and the integration of Islamic faith with traditional African beliefs. Timbuktu became a renowned center of Islamic learning, attracting scholars from across the Muslim world.

The Mali Empire controlled the trans-Saharan trade routes, making it a crucial bridge between North and sub-Saharan Africa. The empire's success was built on the management of trade, the extraction and trade of gold, and the control of salt mines.

## Cultural Code
The Mali Empire's "code" combined Islamic principles with traditional African values and governance systems. It emphasized the divine authority of the Mansa, the importance of trade and commerce, and the synthesis of Islamic and indigenous traditions. The culture was built on oral traditions preserved by griots, sophisticated trade networks, and a hierarchical social structure centered around the imperial court.
