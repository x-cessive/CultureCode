# Social Systems of Ancient Egypt

## Government
Ancient Egypt had a theocratic monarchy system where the pharaoh was considered a living god and the absolute ruler of the land. The pharaoh was responsible for maintaining Ma'at (cosmic order), leading the military, and serving as the high priest of every temple.

The government was highly centralized with a complex bureaucracy that managed agriculture, taxation, construction projects, and trade. The vizier was the pharaoh's chief administrator, followed by regional governors (nomarchs) who managed the administrative divisions called nomes.

## Economics
Egypt had a centrally managed economy based largely on agriculture, particularly the cultivation of wheat and barley along the fertile Nile floodplains. The state controlled most of the economy, collecting taxes in the form of grain and labor.

The economy was also based on:
- Craft production in state workshops
- Mining of precious metals and stones
- Long-distance trade with Nubia, Syria, and Punt
- State-organized labor for construction of monuments

## Family Structure
Egyptian families were patriarchal but with notable exceptions. Men were typically the heads of households, but Egyptian women had more rights than in most other ancient cultures. They could own property, initiate divorce, and conduct business.

Families were often extended, including multiple generations. Marriage was usually monogamous, though the elite practiced polygamy. Children were highly valued, and the eldest son typically inherited property.

## Gender Roles
While the society was largely patriarchal, Egyptian women had significant legal rights. They could:
- Own, buy, and sell property
- Serve on juries
- Make contracts
- Initiate divorce
- Work in various professions

However, most high-status positions were held by men. Women could become priestesses, but rarely held high administrative positions. Notable exceptions occurred when women ruled as pharaohs (e.g. Hatshepsut).

## Religious System
Egyptian society was deeply integrated with religious practices. Temples were economic centers as well as religious ones. The priesthood was a powerful class that controlled significant resources.
