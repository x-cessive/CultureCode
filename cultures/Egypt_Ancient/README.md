## Overview
Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River. It followed predynastic cultures in the region and is generally thought to have begun with the formation of the unified kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt around 3150 BC, under the first pharaoh, Narmer.

Egyptian civilization was based on the Nile River and its floods, which gave rise to agriculture and the first settlements. The civilization lasted for over 3,000 years, ending with the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC when Egypt was conquered by Rome.

## Cultural Code
Ancient Egypt's "code" was highly centralized around the pharaoh, who was considered a living god. The culture emphasized maintaining cosmic order (Ma'at), elaborate burial practices for the afterlife, and monumental architecture that demonstrated divine authority.
